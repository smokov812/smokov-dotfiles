### Automatically build components
By running `Builder/install.py` during the installation phase, it downloads all the necessary packages, which also
will be customized after the build. You don't need to manually customize themes and make edits to the software, after the
builder is executed, all software is immediately configured and customized.

### Browsers
The `Firefox` and `Chromium` browsers are installed by default. It is to `Firefox` that color
themes and some privacy patches. With additional edits, you can use the
the Firefox search box as a calculator.

### No extra stuff
Right from the start the shell consumes only 400-700mb of memory. All software is selected in such a way,
to eliminate many dependencies and heavy components.
